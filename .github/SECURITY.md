# Security Policy

Firstly, thanks for helping make my website safe for everyone!

If you believe you have found a vulnerability in my website, please report it to me as described below.

<details>

<summary>How do I know I have found a vulnerability?</summary>

Ask yourself these questions:

- Can I access something I should not have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people?
- Can I change the functionality of the website?

If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, you are probably dealing with a vulnerability.
Even if you answered 'no' to all questions, you might still be dealing with a vulnerability.
If you are unsure, email [ani@anipalur.com].

## Reporting a Vulnerability

> [!WARNING]  
> **Do not report a vulnerability through an issue, pull request or anywhere else in public.**

Instead, please email [ani@anipalur.com]. Ensure your report is fully contained within the body of the email and not behind a link or an attachment.

Please include as much information below to help me understand and resolve the vulnerability.

- A brief description of the vulnerability
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability
- Full paths to the source file(s) responsible for the vulnerability, if possible
- The potential impact of the vulnerability, e.g. how a bad actor might exploit the issue

I will first acknowledge your report within a few days before following up with more information or a request for more guidance.
I may not be available to resolve the vulnerability quickly due to time zone differences and other commitments, so please be patient.
If you do not receive a response within a week, please [contact me](https://listhis.pages.dev/contact "Learn how to contact me.") using a different contact method.

Thank you!
